## 🚀 Highlights

### Full reject invite flow

Invitations can now be rejected via:

- `POST /invite/reject`
- `canRejectInvite` option (default: `true`)
- `beforeRejectInvite` and `afterRejectInvite` hooks
- `CANT_REJECT_INVITE` error code

This gives you complete control over how rejections are handled, logged, or audited.

[👉 See the api of reject invite](/docs/core/api#reject-invite)

### Cancel invite support

You can now cancel pending invitations with:

- `canCancelInvite`
- `beforeCancelInvite` and `afterCancelInvite` hooks
- Full route and test coverage for the cancel flow

This is especially useful for admin panels or moderation tools where invites may need to be revoked.

[👉 See the api of cancel invite](/docs/core/api#cancel-invite)

### Get invite

A dedicated route for retrieving invite information has been added, making it easier to build custom UIs around invitation state.

### New adapter architecture

0.4 introduces `getInviteAdapter`, centralizing invite and invite usage database logic.

This refactor:
- Simplifies internal architecture
- Makes database integrations cleaner
- Improves long-term extensibility

Routes, hooks, and utilities now rely on this adapter layer for better separation of concerns.

## ✨ More features

### Lifecycle hooks across the invite flow

You now have access to:

- `beforeCreateInvite`
- `afterCreateInvite`
- `beforeAcceptInvite`
- `afterAcceptInvite`
- `beforeRejectInvite`
- `afterRejectInvite`
- `beforeCancelInvite`
- `afterCancelInvite`

Hooks are standardized to receive a single object argument, improving consistency and type safety.

This makes it easier to:
- Trigger side effects
- Send analytics events
- Add logging
- Integrate with external services

---

### Internal improvements

- Routes refactored from `src/routes.ts` into `src/routes/*`
- Renamed internal references from `invite` to `invitation` for clarity
- Improved type definitions
- Expanded test coverage across new flows

---

## 🐛 Bug fixes & Improvements

- Fixed test issues and improved reliability
- Ensured async support for:
  - `canCreateInvite`
  - `canAcceptInvite`
  - `sendUserInvitation`
- Verified hook execution order and arguments via tests
- Fixed lefthook error
- General internal refactors for stability and maintainability

Version 0.4 significantly expands what you can build with the Invite Plugin—while keeping the API clean and predictable.
