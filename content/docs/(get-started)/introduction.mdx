## What is better-auth-invite-plugin?

better-auth-invite-plugin is a [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) plugin that adds a complete invitation system to your app, allowing you to create and manage invites for both new users and existing accounts.
The plugin is maintained by <GithubUser user="0-Sandy" userName="Sandy" /> and is not officially affiliated with Better Auth.

## How invites work

With better-auth-invite-plugin, you can easily invite people to join your app or grant them specific roles. The system is flexible and designed to cover the most common invitation flows without adding unnecessary complexity.

There are two main types of invitations:

- **Private Invitations**: These are tied to a specific email address. Only the person who receives the invite at that email can accept it.

- **Public Invitations**: These can be used by anyone who has access to the invite link or code. They're perfect for broader campaigns or community-based access. For example, you might create a public invite that grants a `discord-member` role to users who joined through your Discord server.
