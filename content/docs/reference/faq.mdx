<Accordions type="single">

  <Accordion title="Why I built the plugin" id="why-built">
  I originally needed an easy way to grant roles without having to:

  - Manually edit the database
  - Build a full admin UI
  - Write one-off scripts

  I also wanted a solution that:

  - Fits naturally into Better Auth's plugin system
  - Doesn't assume a specific permission model
  - Remains flexible for real-world applications

  After implementing it for my own project, I realized it could be useful for other Better Auth users, so I packaged it as a plugin.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is this plugin officially affiliated with Better Auth?" id="official-affiliation">
  No. This is a community-maintained plugin and is not officially affiliated with Better Auth.
  The plugin is maintained by <GithubUser user="0-Sandy"/>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the plugin upgrade a user's role?" id="role-upgrade">
  When an invite is activated, a hook runs after authentication to validate the
  token. If valid, the plugin automatically upgrades the user's role according
  to the invite and marks the invite as used.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to modify my sign-in or sign-up logic?" id="sign-logic">
  No. The plugin integrates seamlessly with the default sign-in and sign-up
  flows using hooks, so no extra logic is required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I limit how many times an invite can be used?" id="max-uses">
  Yes. Each invite has a <code>maxUses</code> property. Once the maximum number
  of uses is reached, the invite becomes invalid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I send invites without specifying an email?" id="public-invites">
  Yes. You can create **public invites** that generate a token or URL. Anyone
  with this token can use the invite without needing an email.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the invited user already exists?" id="existing-user">
  If the invited user already has an account, the invite will be treated as a
  **role upgrade**. If the user does not exist, they can use the invite to
  create a new account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How secure are the invites?" id="cookie-security">
  Invites use tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies, which prevents client-side
  access. Email-specific invites can only be used by the intended recipient.
  Tokens can expire, and usage limits prevent abuse.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize the invite token?" id="customize-token">
  Yes! You can use the default token, a shorter human-readable code, or provide
  a custom token generator using the <code>generateToken</code> option.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to manually activate an invite?" id="manual-activation">
  No. For private invites sent via email, the link automatically activates the
  invite. However, you can use the <code>activateInvite</code> method if you
  prefer manual activation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I control who can create or accept invites?" id="permissions">
  Absolutely. You can use the <code>canCreateInvite</code> function to restrict
  who can create invites, and the <code>canAcceptInvite</code> function to
  control who can accept them. This allows you to enforce role hierarchies and
  other business rules.
</Accordion>
