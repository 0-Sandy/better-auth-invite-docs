The invite plugin allows you to invite users to your app. It supports two main invitation types:
- **Private Invitations**: This invitations is targeted to a specific email address, ensuring only the intended recipient can use the invitation.
- **Public Invitations**: Can be used by anyone that has the invite, it's ideal for role invitations (example: giving the role "discord-member" if you joined from the app's discord server)
