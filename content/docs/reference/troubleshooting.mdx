## `Export expireCookie doesn't exist in target module`

If you see an error like:

```ts
./node_modules/.pnpm/better-auth-invite-plugin@.../dist/hooks.js:2:1
Export expireCookie doesn't exist in target module
  1 | import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";
> 2 | import { expireCookie } from "better-auth/cookies";
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...
The export expireCookie was not found in module .../better-auth/dist/cookies/index.mjs
```

### Why this happens

The plugin relies on the `expireCookie` export, which was introduced in Better Auth v1.4.13.
If you're using an older version of Better Auth, this export won't be available, leading to the error.
(see [PR #7363 in Better Auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7363/changes/243b0c728aa34dcb5d1200f25ea707a1c2d59709#diff-f528705ea9dfb694ce74a60f2e2b4d204f2130b2122aad677a5f99241c968329R300))

### Solution

Upgrade Better Auth to v1.4.13 or newer

```npm
npm install better-auth@latest
```
