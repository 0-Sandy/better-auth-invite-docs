# Creating an invite

To invite a user to our application, we need to create an invite. We can create a public or private invite:
- If the invite has an **email** the user will get an invite email and the invite will be **private**, meaning only that user can use that invite.
- But if no email is present when creating the invite, the invite will be **public**, and the user that created the invite will receive the invite url or token to share.

Example:
```ts
const res = authClient.invite.create({
	role: "user",
	email: "test@test.com" // If email is present, the invite is private
})
```

The response from `invite.create()` depends on whether the invite is **public** or **private**:

### Public invite

No email is sent, and the API returns the invite **token or URL** (depending on your `senderResponse` config):

```ts
{
  status: true,
  message: "token", // The invite token or URL
}
```

### Private invite

The plugin will send an invite email, and the response will be:

```ts
{
  status: true,
  message: "The invitation was sent",
}
```

# Activating an invite

Activating an invite handles two cases depending on the user's session:

- **If the user is not signed in**, the invite is stored in a temporary cookie and the API returns an action telling you the user must sign in or sign up first.
- **If the user is already signed in**, the user's role is updated immediately.

Example:

```ts
const res = await authClient.invite.activate({
  callbackURL: "/auth/invited", // The user will be redirected here after using the invite
  token: "token123",
});
```

## If the user is not signed in

The API returns:

```ts
{
  status: true,
  message: "Invite activated successfully",
  action: "SIGN_IN_UP_REQUIRED",
  redirectTo: "/auth/sign-in-or-sign-up", // This depends on your app's configuration and if the user existed when the invite was created
}
```

At this point, redirect the user to `redirectTo` and perform sign in or sign up. After that, the plugin will automatically activate the invite using a hook, reading the invite data from the cookie. **No further response is returned from the hook**—it just completes the activation once the user has a session.

## If the user is already signed in

The API returns:

```ts
{
  status: true,
  message: "Invite activated successfully",
}
```
