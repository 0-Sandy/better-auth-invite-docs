The Better Auth Invite Plugin is designed with security in mind to protect invitations, tokens, and role upgrades. Below are the main mechanisms and best practices.

## Token Security

- **Unique Tokens:** Each invite uses a unique token to prevent guessing.  
- **Types of Tokens:**
  - **Token:** Long, random string (default, recommended for email and URL invites).  
  - **Code:** Short, human-readable code (easier to share but less secure).  
  - **Custom:** Fully customizable token generator via `generateToken`.  
- **HTTP-Only Cookies:** Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent access from client-side scripts.  
- **Expiration:** Tokens can expire (`invitationTokenExpiresIn`), limiting the window for misuse.

## Permissions and Access Control

- **Creating Invites:** By default, users can create invites. This can be restricted with `canCreateInvite` to prevent role escalation.  
- **Accepting Invites:** Default behavior allows invite acceptance, but `canAcceptInvite` can enforce rules such as only allowing new account creation or restricting certain roles.

## Usage Limits

- Each invite has a `maxUses` property to prevent unlimited sharing.  
- Expired or fully used invites are automatically rejected.

## Secure Delivery

- **Private Invites:** When an invite is sent via email, only that email can activate it.  
- **Public Invites:** Anyone with the token can use it, but usage limits and expiration still apply.  

## Best Practices

- Prefer the default **Token** type for email invites for maximum security.  
- Configure `canCreateInvite` and `canAcceptInvite` to prevent role abuse.  
- Never log or expose invite tokens on the client side.  
- Monitor token usage and expiration to avoid old invites being exploited.
